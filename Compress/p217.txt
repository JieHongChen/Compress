	Having a weekend cabin is the dream of many North Americans. Most people in Canada and the United States live in big cities, and there is a certain romance for them about spending free time in the country. The ultimate fantasy includes buying an older cabin and being able to renovate it and decorate it to your own tastes. Such a desire probably comes from an idea that one is re-living the pioneering experience of the original European settlers in North America.
	The goal of all this renovation is to create a place in which every corner is a cozy retreat. The centerpiece of such a dream cabin is always a big stone fireplace with comfortable chairs nearby. Some people also like to add features such as a hot tub or a sauna to make the weekend cabin a little more like spa. The trick is to keep rustic feel of a cabin in the woods while being able to enjoy all te conveniences of modern living.
	The trouble is that few people have the time, money or skills to make their weekend cabin dream a reality. It's not uncommon to find a family cabin that has been "under construction" for years because the owners only have a few weekends each summer to spend working on their property. Unless one can find a cabin that is already renovated and ready for enjoyment, the only stress-free way to enjoy cabin-living is to rent a cabin. That way someone else can do the work, and you can be at your leisure during your vacation.
