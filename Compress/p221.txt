	I love dogs, because dogs are human beings' best friends. Dogs have a long-time relationship with human beings. Dogs are diligent, loyal and useful animals. They are human beings' companions, servants, and helpers. When we are in need of them, they are always by us.
	Dogs are faithful to their masters. When their masters are attacked, they bark at their masters' attacker loudly, and even attack him. Dogs are in no way snobbish; they never desert their masters because they're poor or sick. Some dogs even guard tombs of their deceased masters until they themselves die of starvation. Therefore, we love them all the more for their loyalty.
	Dogs are also useful animals. Basically, all dogs can watch our houses. They can also help in hunting; they can track down fugitives. They can detect drugs, and they can sniff out whether there are survivors under the ruins. Frankly, dogs are really human beings' good helpers.
